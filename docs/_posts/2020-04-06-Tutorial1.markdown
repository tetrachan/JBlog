# Creating a bash script to ssh into a server

*This will help us create a script so that we don't have to remember the ip addresses of servers or our usernames!*

## Step 1: Creating the file

 a. We first need to create an .sh file named to your choice.
To do this we can run the command

``
$ touch logintoserver.sh
``

b. Now we need to open the file in a text editor like nano, vim or atom. This is up to you but to open it in nano you would run this command:

``
$ nano logintoserver.sh
``
## Step 2: Writing the script

a. Now that we are editing the text file for our script, we can write whatever we want. Since we want this script to ssh into a server for us, we will start with our ssh command that we would normally use. It will end up looking something like this...

``
$ ssh username@serveraddress
``

b. Congratulations, now you don't have to remember the server address in order to login, all you need to remember is your password for the server!
