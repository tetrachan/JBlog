# My Story

I've lived all over, from Ohio to California, Connecticut and now New York state. Living in so many diverse places, getting to know a variety of people, and making new friends has been an experience that I wouldn't trade for anything.

I spent the most time growing up in a small town in Connecticut where I went to middle and high school. During this time, I became very interested in computers and coding. My passion drove me to get as far ahead as I could in computer science and math classes. During my junior year, I decided to apply to The Clarkson School, an early college program at Clarkson University. I was accepted and completed my senior year of high school at Clarkson University while simultaneously completing my freshman year of college.

I decided to try some communications classes and fell in love with UI/UX Design, social media management, public relations, and web design which combined great with my interest in programming. Now I am working my hardest to learn the latest web and UI design standards and creating my own standards as I go along. My goal is to find a position that will utilize my skills and knowledge in front end web design while pushing me to learn more at the same time.{:class="img-responsive" :height="400px" width="400px" : .align-left}
